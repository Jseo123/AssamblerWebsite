# AssamblerWebsite
Assambler website challange page

This was my first website ever. I know it is buggy and looks like it was coded by a 3 years old but it has sentimental value to me as it is the website that
started me on this journey. Please keep in mind I literally didn't know quite well what HTML the day before I started coding this and it was made in what back
then felt like a really short time.
